    <p class="lead">Wood is an important part of who we are.  Early on we chose wood for its inherently durable qualities with the intention of making toys and furniture that could withstand the test of time – and stay out of the landfill.
      Our wooden toys are designed to withstand the wear of play and to be safely enjoyed from generation to generation.
      Our process of sourcing, manufacturing, and shipping only within the U.S. allows us to support our national economy and reduce the often-hefty carbon emissions that come with international trade and shipping.
